But when get falsy value, interval timer set which has 1000 millisecond and execute second, minutes elements and also increase count value. When count value greater than 60 and also event number, remove text-red-300 class list and add text-red-700 class list. Other wise,remove text-red-700 class list and add text-red-300 class list. <span><br><br></span> 
                    chooseQuiz(): This function is used for get answer and answer index. If once clicked in one index then update answer and copy all properties of quizData array. First of all, get index number and answer. After that, check current answer.id is available in quizData index.id using find function. If it is falsy value then execute else statement and push answer into quizData. Other wise, execute if statement, check exist.id and quiz.id is equal or not? if true then, remove specific element in serial index, new element inserted in it's place. and copy all properties of quizData at the specified index and answer also added.
